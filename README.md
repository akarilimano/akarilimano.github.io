What is Mjjir?
==============

It is an interactive novel/web-comics in Telegram: https://t.me/mjjir

The plot is driven by community, but the author has the final word on whether to apply the most suggested plot-choice or not.

What is this game?
==================

It is a form of fan-art and my way to say 'thank you' to the author of the original comics.
The main character in this game - Mmalomer - is some sort of a mascot in the novel with the ability to 'heal angles'.
It was used only once metaphorically but I've thought it would be fun to take this line literally and make it into a game.
His tail is a Bezier curve - I find them truly amazing.

'Healing' in this game is making angles dissapear by clicking on them.
Clicks make angles more obtuse, and when you reach 360° angle will be considered healed and you'll get another one.

Why JS? Why one file? Why code is ugly?
=======================================

Initially I just wanted to create a simple game, spent no more than few hours on it.
I was surprised community liked it so much and translated into several languages, helped to test and suggested bugfix.
I'm not a JS dev, but I like the flexibility it provides.
I will stick to my initial intention to keep the code in one file, use no frameworks and the way I like it.

Feel free to take it, edit whatever you don't like and share. Thanks to every person who cared enough to play, enjoy and read this.
